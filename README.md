# cityGraph

## To do:

lots of fixing of things!
stop re-rendering scene children on every frame its very expensive.
only regenerate the changed bits of the graph not the whole thing when the graph changes (regen moves trees and messes with building plots at the moment)
fix the commented out traffic light placement code, i had to stop as it was giving me too much of a headache!
